# Face Recognition using Tensorflow 

## Forker notice

The original project was developed by David Sandberg and has little changes here, although  

There are 2 major branches of changes in this fork:  
- There is a proper setup which gives you an opportunity to install and import facenet in your project  
- There is no contrib or test, for ease of access.  

The original project reached the state, which was sufficient for my studies to call it complete and embed its trained models.  

## Overview

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the face recognizer described in the paper
["FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832). The project also uses ideas from the paper ["A Discriminative Feature Learning Approach for Deep Face Recognition"](http://ydwen.github.io/papers/WenECCV16.pdf) as well as the paper ["Deep Face Recognition"](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2015/Parkhi15/parkhi15.pdf) from the [Visual Geometry Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at Oxford.

## Compatibility
The code is tested using Tensorflow r1.2 under Ubuntu 14.04 with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5. The test cases can be found [here](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/tree/master/test). Also has been tested by @Btlk to work under Windows 10 x64 and Python 3.6.
